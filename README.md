# Online-FoodStore
 The project is based MERN stack development. It is scalable and future proof. The project contains registration and login page. The site contains different pages for different functions and information like data of all the customers and their bills, home pages includes different food items according to the category chosen,etc. It also have cart functionality in which we can increase or decrease the quantity of the items. We can also generate the bills for different users and can print it.
 I have used React as frontend & Redux as state management. Nodejs & express for backend with Mongodb as Database.
